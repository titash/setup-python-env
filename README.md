# Bash Script for Python Development Setup

This bash script automates the setup process for Python development by 
- creating a virtual environment 
- initializing a Git repository 
- adding a comprehensive `.gitignore` file specifically for Python projects.

## Prerequisites

- Git: Make sure Git is installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Download the script:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://example.com/setup-python-env.sh -o setup-python-env.sh
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-python-env.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./setup-python-env.sh
   ```

   The script will be executed whenever you change directory using the `cd` command, and it will automatically check if a virtual environment exists and activate it. If not, it will prompt you to create one.

4. Follow the prompts to create a virtual environment and initialize a Git repository.

5. Once the script completes, you will have a virtual environment set up and a Git repository initialized with a Python-specific `.gitignore` file added to the first commit.

## Notes

- The script assumes that your Python projects are stored under the `~/repos` directory. Adjust the path in the `check_venv` function if your projects are located elsewhere.

- The default branch for the Git repository is set to `main`. If you prefer a different default branch name, modify the `git init` command in the script.

- The `.gitignore` file used in this script is a comprehensive one for Python projects. You can modify it or replace it with a different `.gitignore` file to suit your specific project requirements.
